# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Overview

This project is a small-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system implemented to explore concepts related to integrating information retrieval with language models. The system leverages PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search, facilitating retrieval of relevant documents to augment responses generated by a language model.

## Features

- **Vector Search Integration:** Uses `pgvector` in PostgreSQL for storing and querying vector embeddings.
- **Document Management:** Efficiently adds, updates, and retrieves documents for embedding generation.
- **Language Model Augmentation:** Combines retrieved documents with a prompt to generate coherent and contextually relevant answers.
- **Scalable Backend:** Modular structure, making it easy to adapt for more extensive datasets and advanced models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL with `pgvector` extension installed

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd rag-system
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure PostgreSQL:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Enable the `pgvector` extension in your database:

     ```sql
     CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
     ```

   - Create a database and configure its connection details in the `.env` file.

5. Run the setup scripts to initialize the database and load initial data.

## Usage

1. **Start the System:**

   Run the main script to launch the RAG system and send queries via the CLI to retrieve responses:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the system.
- `database.py`: Handles database connections and operations.
- `file_loader.py`: Handles input documents.
- `embedding.py`: Generates and manages vector embeddings and chunking.
- `generation_model.py`: Core logic for retrieval and augmentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

## Future Improvements

- **Scaling:** Add support for distributed storage and processing for larger datasets.
- **Model Enhancement:** Integrate with more advanced language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 or fine-tuned open-source models(LLaMA).
- **UI/UX:** Develop a new interface for easier interaction.
- **Performance Metrics:** Implement benchmarks to evaluate retrieval and generation quality.
- **Restructure code base**: The code still needs a lot of changes to meet standards.
