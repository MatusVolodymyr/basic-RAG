Young children may have tantrums because of strong emotions, while older children may have tantrums because they don't know how to express or manage their feelings. Overstimulation can also cause tantrums, as children don't always recognize when bright lights or loud noises are bothering them. Anxiety can also cause tantrums, such as when a child feels anxious due to an unexpected event, unrealistic demand, or lack of routine.\n \nTantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable. They can have a meltdown because they can't have something they want (like a toy or candy) or can\u2019t get someone to do what they want (like getting a parent to pay attention to them immediately or getting a sibling to give up the tablet).

Because toddlers can't always say what they want or need, and because words describing feelings are more complicated and develop later, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease.\nToddlers want independence and control over their environment \u2014 more than they can actually handle. This can lead to power struggles as a child thinks \"I can do it myself\" or \"I want it, give it to me.\" When kids discover that they can't do it and can't have everything they want, they may have a tantrum.\nHow Can We Avoid Tantrums?\nTry to prevent tantrums from happening in the first place, whenever possible.
